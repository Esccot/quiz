# Quiz App 🧠

A simple yet powerful interactive Quiz App built using **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The app displays questions one at a time, fetches them dynamically from an API, handles user selections, manages timers, calculates scores with negative marking, and maintains a leaderboard.

This project was built to deeply practice **core JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, asynchronous code (fetch), browser storage, and event handling**.
